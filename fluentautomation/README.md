# scriptcs and FluentAutomation

## Running the sample
* Make sure scriptcs is [installed](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs-samples/blob/master/README.md)
* Install packages `scriptcs -install`
* Run `rm packages.config` or manually delete the packages.config from the directory. This is a temporary fix for the script pack not loading properly.
* Run `scriptcs start.csx` (Some users may need to run this command as Administrator)

## Comments

Uses ScriptCs.FluentAutomation script pack to run and present results for automated tests right from your console.
