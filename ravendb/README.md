## Comments

You're ouput should be a list of assemblies needed by RavenDB then the following:

Starting RavenDB Server, Please Be Patient...
RavenDB Started, Listening On http://localhost:8081

This will start a RavenDB embedded server instance. Currently the directory for you data is C:\scriptcs\ravendb. You can change this in the script to be anywhere you'd like.

Note: The server instance will only be available as long as the script is running.
